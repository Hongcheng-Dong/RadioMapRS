# RadioMap_Dataset_Reflection/Scattering_Counts

## RadioMap_Dataset

This dataset is generated using the TensorFlow-based open-source library for simulating ray tracing (RT),
Sionna (https://nvlabs.github.io/sionna/index.html), with varying sums of reflections and scatterings. The simulation
environment is based on different urban areas in China. The region of interest is a square area with a side length of
620 meters, and the transmitters (TXs) are uniformly distributed at an altitude of 1.5 meters. The heights of the ground
receivers (RXs) are fixed at 1.5 meters.

In the simulation:

- Environment frequency: 2.5 GHz
- Transmitter power: 23 dBm
- Transmitter height: 1.5 meters
- Transmitter antenna array: 8×4 elements with both vertical and horizontal spacing of 0.06 meters (half wavelength),
  isotropic radiation pattern, and dual polarization
- Receiver height: 1.5 meters
- Receiver antenna array: single element with isotropic radiation pattern and cross polarization

## Document:

**Scene_File**: The simulation project of Sionna, containing 500 scene folders created and exported by Blender 3.6.

**RadioMap_raw**: The raw simulation output files generated by Sionna. The numbers in the filenames '1.npy' to '500.npy'
represent the simulated scene number. Each file has a shape of 256×256×10×6, corresponding to (Rx_coordinates(i),
Rx_coordinates(j), Tx_number, depth_max), and the values represent RSSI. Here, depth_max indicates the total number of
reflections and scatterings, with depth_max=0 representing the scenario where reflections and scatterings are not
considered.

**RSSI**: The grayscale image obtained after processing the RadioMap_raw file. The specific processing involves
converting the value at each point using \(\max\{\frac{P_{R} - P_{R, thr}}{P_{R, max} - P_{R, thr}}, 0\}\) to a value
between 0 and 1, where \(P_{R, max}\) is the maximum received signal strength value, which is -13dB, and \(P_{R, thr}\)
is set to -70dB. For example, `1_0_0.png` represents the RadioMap generated for the 1st scene, 0th Tx, and when
depth_max is 0.

**Tx**: The grayscale image representing the Tx position for each scene, where the pixel value 255 represents the Tx
position, and all other values are 0. For example, `1_0.png` represents the position map for the 0th Tx in the 1st
scene.

**Scene**: The grayscale image representing the scene, generated by performing a cross-section operation at 1.5 meters
in the 3D simulation scene. In this image, pixel value 0 represents buildings, and all other values are 0.

## Example of the RSSI maps corresponding to the Scenes and the Txs.

### Scene Image

| Scene 1                            | Tx 1_0                     |
|------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| ![scene_1.png](assets/scene_1.png) | ![1_0.png](assets/1_0.png) |

### RadioMap Images

| RSSI 1_0_0                     | RSSI 1_0_1                     | RSSI 1_0_2                     |
|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| ![1_0_0.png](assets/1_0_0.png) | ![1_0_1.png](assets/1_0_1.png) | ![1_0_2.png](assets/1_0_2.png) |

| RSSI 1_0_3                     | RSSI 1_0_4                     | RSSI 1_0_5                     |
|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| ![1_0_3.png](assets/1_0_3.png) | ![1_0_4.png](assets/1_0_4.png) | ![1_0_5.png](assets/1_0_5.png) |

In the example, RSSI 1_0_0 indicates no reflection and scattering, while RSSI 1_0_1 indicates a total of one reflection
and scattering, and so on.

## Future

The dataset with each scene having more Txs is being processed and will be updated soon.
